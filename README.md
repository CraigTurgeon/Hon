To Connect Client to Server API

1.  Run Hon:  ionic serve
2.  Run Hon-Server:  npm start

**NOTE:  You will need to create a user via postman so that you can login.  See index.js in Hon-Server for example data to send for login.  Or you can disable the if result.success check in the login function in the client.
